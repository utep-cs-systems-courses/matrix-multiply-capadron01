Program to multiply nxn matrices. It Generates two square matrices and stores
them in the given files with the given dimension and values. The second matrix
is just generated with a value+1 greater than the value given by the user. I used three for loops to be able to
read the matrices(one vertically and the other horizontally) and store the value in a third matrix. Another algorithm
that was used was by using a fourth for loop and applying a block. A third algorithm was used by making the original
algorithm with the three for loops and parallelizing it.
This happened with 1 thread

This happened with 2 threads

This happened with 4 threads

This happened with 8 threads

The more threads the system uses the faster it ran, although when using more threads it would slightly faster. The syste only has limit of processors so no matter how many threads are placed it wouldn’t affect the speed on which the tasks are done.

How to use:
To use this program git clone this repository and cd towards the file containing
this repository then run-

python3 matrixUtils.py -s 1024 -v value -f matrix1 -f2 matrix2 -r result

-s:
  Size of matrix. Default is 1024
-v:
  Value to fill matrix. Default is 1
-f:
  File to save the first matrix. If not existing, program will generate one.
-f2:
  File to save the second matrix. If not existing, program will generate one.
-r:
  File to save the resulting matrix. If not existing, program will generate one.
