Program to multiply nxn matrices. It Generates two square matrices and stores
them in the given files with the given dimension and values. The second matrix
is just generated with a value+1 greater than the value given by the user. I used three for loops to be able to
read the matrices(one vertically and the other horizontally) and store the value in a third matrix

How to use:
To use this program git clone this repository and cd towards the file containing
this repository then run-

python3 matrixUtils.py -s 1024 -v value -f matrix1 -f2 matrix2 -r result

-s:
  Size of matrix. Default is 1024
-v:
  Value to fill matrix. Default is 1
-f:
  File to save the first matrix. If not existing, program will generate one.
-f2:
  File to save the second matrix. If not existing, program will generate one.
-r:
  File to save the resulting matrix. If not existing, program will generate one.
